## Description
Our team put together a web app for users to explore Marvel Characters. We used Marvel's API to get character's thumbnails and descriptions. We also used Giphy's API to get gifs that are related to the Marvel Characters.

## Technology and Tools
We utilized fetch and then for our API calls. Tailwindcss was used to style our site and to make it a mobile first responsive design. Local storage keeps user's history, which can be reset through a modal. 

## Future Development
It would be nice to add a form with an autofill, so that users could explore more than the preset characters.
